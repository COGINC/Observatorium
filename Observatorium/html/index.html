			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Our guild is based around the concept that one must Observe to see greater meaning.</p>
			<p>We have been around since the spring of 2020 and are already at half capacity, that's over 50 membes! We have an open doors policy and help new players achieve a better gaming experience, through utilization of statting gear pieces with lvl 100 stats, making it MUCH faster to level and easier to see their way through progrssion of the game.</p>
			<p>Osterich meat, Honor Parties, and the Coast of Opportunity are just a few ways we bring players from level 10 to 50+ in less than a week. While we aren't neccisarily about power leveling, we do encourage our members to achieve level 55 sooner rather than later, so that they may enjoy the Main Questline that will lead them to level 100 over the course of the next several months.</p>
			<p>Our Guild Leader: Oupavoc, Works hard to schedule events and do festival dailies in order to make zodiac pets.. Special pets that Give Great Bonuses when summoned. Oupavoc also takes people on solo runs for gear and stat pieces for really hammering out the extra attribute bonuses. But above all else he loves his discord general voice channel!</p>

			<p>Runes of Magic was released as an FTP micropay model MMORPG in 2009. Since then It has recieved many praises and awards. The single most appealing aspect to this game is the fact that each character plays as two classes (example: Mage/Warrior) at the same time. This allows for a VAST amount of class combinations, which keeps everything interesting. That is why this game grosses over $1,000,000 per year still to this day!</p>
